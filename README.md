## Overview

This website is created as part of Frontend Mentor challenges. It is not completely responsive. The min-width is 346px.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

I became more conversant with Javascript and since this will be my first project on front mentor. I believe I can improve and create a better app.

### Continued development

I will be focusing on making any other projects I will be building more responsive and be dealing with javascript more.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me with refreshing my knowledge on some properties I forgot about.
